            Hi, I'm Divyasri. I completed M.Sc (Integrated 5 years) Computer Science in College Of Engineering Guindy (Passed out - July 2023), Anna University, Chennai.
            I'm interested in Web Development. 
            I'm familiar with ReactJS, React Native, NodeJS and SQL. 
            I have done a 6 months internship in ReactJS and 4 months internship in React Native.  
            I have hands-on experience in building and maintaining both client-side and server-side applications. 
            This enables me to understand the entire development process, from UI/UX design to database management. 
            I have a commitment to continuous learning and improvement. 
            I am always eager to expand my skill set and stay updated with the latest industry trends, which is vital in the fast-paced tech world
